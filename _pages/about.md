## About this Site

This site focuses primarily on our endeavors in astrophotography-- gear, process,
software, and, of course, targets & images.  We reserve the right to delve
into other topcs that are loosely related to astrophotography-- If we have to
pack it into the car for a night observing then it is fair game.  Posts will be
tagged appropriately so readers don't have to suffer through topics they aren't
interested in.

### Getting Around

This site has a pretty simple layout - it's all static thanks to
[jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), and should be fairly responsive. At the top you
see a main navigation bar.  The top left corner has the site title which will
always get you back to the root level.  Navigation is broken up into "posts" and
"notes".

Posts are like journal entries, happening at a point in time.  They will contain
_tags_, which tell you the main topic.  I don't have the list of tags yet, but
you can be sure that `astrophotography` and `image` will be in the mix.  You can
find posts by either [date](/year-archive/) or by [tag](/tags/).

Notes, on the other hand, are more "timeless".  These might be tutorials or
little one-offs.  Full disclosure here - I won't know what goes where until I
actually put up some content, but I _promise_ that I will update this doc when I
do.  Unless I forget.

### Minutia

For hosting we leverage [GitHub Pages and Jekyll](https://help.github.com/articles/about-github-pages-and-jekyll/), 
and use a somewhat tweaked version of the 
[minimal-mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) theme, with a dark color palette.
