    title: Early on in the construction phase.  First chance I had to go out there when they were building and they made quite a bit of progress!  This one shows the door side, with a cutout for a window.

With the Astroshed nearly complete I thought that it was time to post some pictures of the progress and what all has gone into this project.

We built the astroshed at GHRO (the Gayle H. Riggsbee Observatory) which is about 50 minutes from my house.  Very special thanks to all of the great [CAAC](http://www.charlotteastronomers.org) members that helped with this project, I couldn't have done it without you!
