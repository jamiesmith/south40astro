Welcome to [south40astro](https://www.south40astro.com), where we talk about astronomy gear with a strong focus on astrophotography.  "South 40" is nestled on the south side of our club's observatory in South Carolina. We'll be sharing blogs, videos, tutorials, and, of course, completed works.

Our members have a very wide variety of equipment, ranging from DSLRs with wide & fast lenses to long focal length CDKs, with an equally diverse set of mounts-- ranging from small camera trackers to permanently-mounted, full-encoder mounts.  Strangely, I don't think anyone has an Astro-Physics mount.

The skies here aren't Arizona or New Mexico dark, but it is considerably darker than our yards.  You can actually see the Milky Way band at the right time of year, and even more with a few exposures with a DSLR, a camera tracker, and a simple kit lens.

and Andromeda isn't lost in the glow of uptown Charlotte:

Stay tuned, we've got a bunch of great folks ready to share their wisdom.  If you're near the Charlotte area, we encourage you to join us for a star party when this whole COVID-19 fiasco settles down.
